# golang-dummy-api
A basic RESTful API written in Go. 

This is a very basic API written in Go. It's not connected to an actual database because the idea of the project was for me to explore the basics of writing an API with Go. The data comes from a an Array of book information. The API supports GETTING all of the books in the "database", GETTING a specific book by referencing its ID, POSTING a new book and DELETING any existing book by referencing its ID.
